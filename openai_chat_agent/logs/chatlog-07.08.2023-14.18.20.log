The study also estimated that the life expectancy of cats in 1981 was 5.42 years, which is higher than the previously available data from 1981 and 1982 that showed a life expectancy of only 4.2 years. The study found that female cats had a significantly higher life expectancy at birth compared to male cats, with a difference of approximately 1 year. However, this difference decreased as cats reached the age of 16-17 years. Purebred and mixed-breed cats also had higher life expectancies compared to their male counterparts. The study reported a life expectancy at birth of 11.54 years for purebred cats and 11.12 years for mixed-breed cats. Additionally, it is suggested that mixed-breed cats are less affected by hereditary illnesses and therefore have a longer average lifespan compared to purebred cats. The lifespan of cats can also vary depending on their breed, with Maine Coon cats having an average lifespan of 10-13 years and Siamese cats living up to 15-20 years.\n\nUse this summary for to answer the query below, without any additional use of the\nsearch tool. \n\nSearh results:\n\nAccording to the information provided, a study on life expectancy in cats found that the average life expectancy increased by 2.6 months (2.01%) each year from 2013 to 2019.
