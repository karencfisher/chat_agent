Human: What is forward-forward neural networks?

AI: Forward-forward neural networks is an algorithm that replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation by two forward passes, a positive and a negative one. It is used for training deep neural networks without resorting to reinforcement learning.

Human: Who created it?

AI: The forward-forward neural network algorithm was created by Geoffrey Hinton. The algorithm replaces the forward and backward passes of backpropagation with two forward passes, and is used for training deep neural networks without resorting to reinforcement learning.
