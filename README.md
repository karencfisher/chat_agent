# chat_agent

This is building a conversational AI agent, integrating ideas about autonomous agents and ReAct. I am inspired by
frameworks such as 
<a href='https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html', target='_blank'>LangChain</a> 
and Marc PÃ¤pper's (much simpler) <a href='https://github.com/mpaepper/llm_agents', target='_blank'>LLM-agents</a>.
My approach is somewhere between the two, as it is more specific than an extensive framework such as LangChain,
but more complete than LLM-agents. It is also indirectly inspired by 
<a href='https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi', targe='_blank'>BabyAGI</a>, though at present I am taking 
different approach in that the steps for a task are determined step by step, a posteriori as it were.
