# chat_agent

This is building a conversational AI agent, integrating ideas about autonomous agents and 
[ReAct](https://react-lm.github.io/). I am inspired by
frameworks such as [LangChain](https://python.langchain.com/docs/get_started/introduction.html)
and Marc PÃ¤pper's (much simpler) [LLM-agents](https://github.com/mpaepper/llm_agents).
My approach is somewhere between the two, as it is more specific than an extensive framework such as LangChain,
but more complete than LLM-agents. It is also indirectly inspired by 
[BabyAGI](https://github.com/yoheinakajima/babyagi), though at present I am taking 
different approach in that the steps for a task are determined step by step, a posteriori as it were.
